		<h2>Game Design</h2>
<img src="board game.jpg" alt="board game" /> <img src="board.jpg" alt="Full Board" />
<p>This was the first game we made in class. A few classmates and I build a board game with a mat and pieces to place on the board. These are the pieces combineded. The game is called Bunker Rush.</p>

<img src="beer token.jpg" alt="Beer Token" />
<p>This is our 2nd game my group have made during this semester. It's an ablib game similar to "Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples". You pick up 5 cards from the deck of 50 and choose 3 of them to use to create your story. Then the Innkeeper gets to choose which story is edgy. Whoever wins gets a Beer token for that round. Then the Innkeeper changes. The game is called What's Your Story.</p>

<p>Our last and final game we made in class is similar to What's Your Story, but this is like a DLC. An add on to the game known as What's Your Journey. You have a challenge deck, Action deck and setting deck. The Innkeeper flips over a challenge and a setting card. You pick up 3 cards from the Actions and choose one to play. Whoever the Innkeeper picks for the best Journey wins a treasure chest token.</p>
<h2>Selective Topics of Art Technology</h2>
<p>Here are some art projects I've done that involves looking for other artists work, taking there techniques and putting them in our own work.</p>
<img src="star wars.jpg" alt="Star Wars" />
<p>**Composition** Taking 3 photos from online and putting them all together to make a scene.</p>
<img src="hairglow.jpg" alt="hair glowing" />
<p>Research a digital painter. Create an image that incorporates aesthetics, sensibilities, or techniques of the artist. You can emulate the artist’s approach as much or as little as student determines, but should NOT be a copy of an existing work.</p>
<img src="rainbow.jpg" alt="rainbow" />
<p>Research an analogue (traditional) painter. Create an image that incorporates aesthetics, sensibilities, or techniques of the artist. Can emulate the artist’s approach as much or as little as student determines, but should NOT be a copy of an existing work.</p>
<img src="irresistible.jpg" alt="irresistible" />
<p>Create a digital painting based on a song, story, or poem. Utilize techniques you learned in the previous projects to visualize this narrative as a digital painting. I used irresistible by Fall Out Boy.</p>
<h2>Game Developement</h2>
<img src="pinball.jpg" alt="pinball" />
<p>Martian, Kyle and I made a Pinball game for our 2nd project. It's all done in a program called Unity. Also, I made a fighter planes game called Asteriod Fighter.</p>
